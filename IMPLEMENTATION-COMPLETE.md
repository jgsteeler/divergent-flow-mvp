## Your Questions - Answered

### Q1: When should I stop using Spark?

**Answer: NOW ✅**

**Why?**
- ✅ Phase 1-2 complete (foundation solid)
- ✅ Phase 3+ needs complex logic (80% logic, 20% UI remaining)
- ✅ LLM API integration coming (Phase 4)
- ✅ Backend architecture needed (Phase 5+)
- ✅ Your PRD is perfect for AI agents (detailed & specific)

**Quantitative Indicator**: When UI work is <30% of remaining effort, switch to AI agents. Your project: ~20% UI, 80% logic/integration.

### Q2: How do I set up an AI coding agent?

**Answer: 3 Options, 5-10 minute setup**

| Tool | Best For | Cost | Setup |
|------|----------|------|-------|
| **GitHub Copilot** | Already using VS Code | $10/mo | 5 min |
| **Cursor** | Most powerful | Free trial | 10 min |
| **Aider** | CLI lovers | API costs only | 5 min |

**Read**: AI-AGENT-QUICK-START.md for step-by-step instructions

### Q3: How do I finish the MVP?

**Answer: 6-10 weeks with AI agent (vs 3-6 months manual)**

| Phase | Time | Features |
|-------|------|----------|
| Phase 3 | 1-2 weeks | Property validation |
| Phase 4 | 2-3 weeks | LLM integration, date parsing |
| Phase 5 | 1-2 weeks | Dashboard, Next Action, Quick Wins |
| Phase 6 | 1 week | Completion tracking |
| Testing | 1-2 weeks | E2E tests, polish |

**Read**: TRANSITION-GUIDE.md for detailed roadmap with AI prompts

### Q4: How do I scale to .NET backend?

**Answer: 3-6 months, full architecture provided**

**Migration Steps:**
1. Complete MVP with current setup (6-10 weeks)
2. Build ASP.NET Core backend (1-2 weeks setup)
3. Implement REST APIs (2-3 weeks)
4. Replace Spark KV with React Query (4-5 weeks)
5. Deploy to Azure + Vercel (5-6 weeks)

**Architecture:**
```
Frontend (React + Vite)
    ↓ HTTPS REST API
Backend (ASP.NET Core 8)
    ↓
PostgreSQL + Redis
```
